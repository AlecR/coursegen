### Technical Debt

* In Citem, lecture_num and _date should refer to "event" not a lecture
* Is null item handling in Scheduler done the right way? Does it pay?
* Look at the two constructors of citem. There's a nicer way to handle that
* Make the way mocks are built in specs more consitent
* A way to have a nested section which is not an 'event' based section
* Clean up the placement of the .js files for the search stuff. It's a bit messy

### Features

* Add a macro for <%= link_to_next_lecture %>
* Add a way to automatically generate a list of homeworks on a single page
